# 📌 Introduction
This case study examines how Cyclistic, a bike-share company based in Chicago, can increase its annual membership by analyzing the riding behaviors of casual users. The objective is to identify the differences between casual riders and annual members, using these insights to develop a data-driven marketing strategy. The project utilizes public trip data from Cyclistic's operations over the past year and employs data cleaning, analysis, and visualization techniques using R. It operates under the assumption that casual riders may be converted into members if their usage patterns and preferences are better understood.

## 🔍 My Approach
- Documented the data cleaning and manipulation processes.
- Analyzed usage trends from April 2024 to March 2025.
- Presented visualizations.
- Provided recommendations.

# Data Analysis Process

## ✅ Ask: Identifying the Business Task
The goal is to identify trends in how annual members and casual riders use bikes differently and design marketing strategies to convert casual riders.

### 👥 Stakeholders

- Lily Moreno (Director of Marketing)
- Cyclistic Executive Team

## 📁 Prepare: Data Collection and ROCCC Check
For this case study, I downloaded trip data from April 2024 to March 2025 from the “https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html” a publicly available dataset. This dataset was provided by Motivate International Inc. and is governed by a license agreement.
I evaluated the dataset using the ROCCC standard:
- Reliable – It is provided by Motivate International Inc., Cyclistic's official partner.

- **Original** – The data is raw and publicly available, serving as a primary data source.

- **Comprehensive** – It includes thirteen columns such as ride ID, start and end station names, and more, over 12 months.

- **Current** – The data covers the most recent 12-month period.

- **Cited** – The dataset is cited properly along with its licensing terms.

While reviewing the dataset, I observed some issues—rows with missing start or end stations, and entries where the start time occurred after the end time.

## 🧹 Process: Cleaning and Preparing the Data
I chose R for this analysis because it allows me to clean, prepare, organize, analyze, and visualize data efficiently in one environment.
I collected the dataset from the [Divvy Trip Data Repository](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html), covering April 2024 to March 2025. The dataset meets the ROCCC standard. Then i uploaded the datasets in R.
```{r load-libraries, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)   # For dplyr, ggplot2, etc.
library(readr)       # For read_csv()
library(lubridate)   # For date and time handling
library(janitor)     # For clean_names() and data cleaning helpers
library(scales)
```

```{r load-monthly-data}

```
Before moving into cleaning and analysis, I ensured the data was **accurate and consistent** across all 12 files by checking column names and data types.
```{r check-consistency}
# Check column names and structure
colnames(April_2024)
colnames(May_2024)
colnames(June_2024)
colnames(July_2024)
colnames(August_2024)
colnames(September_2024)
colnames(October_2024)
colnames(November_2024)
colnames(December_2024)
colnames(January_2025)
colnames(February_2025)
colnames(March_2025)
```

``` {r echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
str(April_2024)
str(May_2024)
str(June_2024)
str(July_2024)
str(August_2024)
str(September_2024)
str(October_2024)
str(November_2024)
str(December_2024)
str(January_2025)
str(February_2025)
str(March_2025)
```
After confirming structural alignment, I created a unified data frame by combining all the monthly datasets. The next code block performs this merging using the rbind() function. I then calculated the total number of rows—5,779,568 rows across thirteen columns—giving me a sense of the dataset’s size.
```{r combine-datasets}
# Combine all datasets into one
trip_data_202425 <- rbind(April_2024,May_2024,June_2024,July_2024,August_2024,September_2024,October_2024,November_2024,December_2024,January_2025,February_2025,March_2025)
```
To begin cleaning, I removed rows where the data was incomplete or incorrect. Specifically, I removed 492 rows where the start time was after the end time and 6,589 rows where essential values were missing. And changed converted time columns to date and time format from character format.
```{r clean-data}
clean_trip_data_2024_25 <- trip_data_202425 %>% filter(ended_at > started_at)
clean_trip_data_2024_25 <- na.omit(clean_trip_data_2024_25)
```

```{r Convert time columns}
clean_trip_data_2024_25$started_at <- ymd_hms(clean_trip_data_2024_25$started_at)
clean_trip_data_2024_25$ended_at <- ymd_hms(clean_trip_data_2024_25$ended_at)
```
Once cleaned, I calculated the ride lengths in minutes for each entry using the difftime() function. To facilitate analysis, I also created new columns such as day of the week, month, year, date, and hour of the ride, which I did using functions from the lubridate package. Each of these transformations is introduced with code that clearly describes the operation.

```{r add new columns}
clean_trip_data_2024_25<- clean_trip_data_2024_25 %>%
  mutate(
    ride_length = as.numeric(difftime(ended_at, started_at, units = "mins")),
    day_of_week = wday(started_at, label = FALSE),
    month = month(started_at, label = FALSE),
    year = year(started_at),
    date = as.Date(started_at),
    hour = hour(started_at),
    time = format(started_at, format = "%H:%M"))
```

## 📊 Analyse
In the Analyse phase, I explored how casual and member riders differ in terms of ride duration, frequency, and seasonal usage. This helps Cyclistic understand key behavioral trends that can shape targeted marketing strategies.

### 🔸 Average Ride Duration by User Type
This analysis was conducted to compare how ride duration patterns vary between members and casual users. Understanding these differences helps identify usage behavior, which can inform user segmentation, service design, and marketing strategies.

```{r avg-ride-length}
avg_ride <- clean_trip_data_2024_25 %>%  group_by(member_casual) %>% summarise(avg_ride_length = mean(ride_length))
```

### 🔸 Number of Rides by Day of the Week
This analysis aims to explore how ride frequency varies across the days of the week for different user types. Identifying daily usage trends helps in understanding peak demand periods, planning resource allocation, and tailoring services to user behavior patterns.

```{r daily-patterns}
rides_by_day <- clean_trip_data_2024_25 %>%
  count(day_of_week, member_casual)
```

### 🔸 Average Ride Duration per Day
This chart helps us see how ride times change across the week. It gives clues about when people are riding just to get somewhere and when they’re taking their time—like on weekends. This helps in understanding how the service is used on different days.

```{r avg ride by day, warning = FALSE }
avg_by_day <- clean_trip_data_2024_25 %>%
  group_by(member_casual, day_of_week) %>%
  summarise(avg_length = mean(ride_length))
```

### 🔸 Monthly Ride Count
This analysis looks at how the number of rides changes from month to month. It helps us understand seasonal patterns and how weather or time of year might affect how often people use the service.

```{r monthly-ride}
monthly_rides <- clean_trip_data_2024_25%>%
  count(month, member_casual)
```

## 📈 Share
To effectively communicate the analysis results, I created a series of visualizations using the `ggplot2` package. These visuals help identify trends in user behavior, making insights clearer for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

### 🔹 Average Ride Duration by Day of the Week
This plot compares how long casual riders and members ride on each day.

```{r plot-avg-duration-day, fig.height=5,fig.width=10, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(avg_by_day, aes(x = day_of_week, y = avg_length, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge", width = 0.7) +   geom_text(aes(label = round(avg_length, 1)), 
            position = position_dodge(0.7), 
            vjust = -0.5, 
            color = "black", size = 4) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("casual" = "#e31a1c", "member" = "#1f78b4")) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 30), breaks = seq(0, 30, by = 5)) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = 1:7,
    labels = c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday")
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Average Ride Duration by Day of Week",
    x = "Day of the Week",
    y = "Average Ride Length (Minutes)",
    fill = "User Type"
  ) +
  theme_bw(base_size = 14) +  
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
    axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
    legend.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),  
    panel.border = element_rect(color = "black", fill = NA))
```

The plot above conveys that casual riders consistently take longer trips than members, with their ride durations peaking on weekends—particularly on Sundays and Saturdays. This trend indicates that casual users likely use the service for leisure purposes. In contrast, members exhibit shorter and more consistent ride durations across all days of the week, suggesting usage primarily for commuting or other routine activities.

### 🔹 Monthly Ride Volume by User Type
```{r plot-monthly-ride-volume, fig.height=5,fig.width=10, echo=FALSE}
 ggplot(monthly_rides, aes(x = month, y = n, fill = member_casual)) +
   geom_col(position = "dodge", width = 0.7) +
   scale_fill_manual(values = c("casual" = "#e31a1c", "member" = "#1f78b4")) +
   scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
   scale_x_continuous( breaks = 1:12, labels = c("January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"))+
  labs( title = "Monthly Rides by User Type",  x = "Month", y = "Number of Rides", fill = "User Type") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 14) +
  theme( plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
          axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
          axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
          legend.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
          panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
```

The plot above highlights a clear seasonal trend in ride usage for both user types, with activity peaking during the summer months from June to September. Casual riders, in particular, show a strong sensitivity to weather, as their numbers drop sharply during the colder winter months. In contrast, members maintain a steadier level of usage throughout the year. This pattern suggests that casual riders primarily engage in recreational biking during pleasant weather, while members are more consistent users—likely relying on the service for regular commuting or daily travel needs.

### 🔹 Number of Rides by Day of the Week
```{r fig.height=5,fig.width=10, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(rides_by_day, aes(x = day_of_week, y = n, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge", width = 0.7) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("casual" = "#e31a1c", "member" = "#1f78b4")) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(
    title = "Number of Rides by Day of the Week",
    x = "Day of the Week",
    y = "Number of Rides",
    fill = "User Type"
  ) +
  theme_bw(base_size = 14) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
    axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
    legend.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank())+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:7, labels = c("Sunday","Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"))
```

The plot above illustrates distinct usage patterns between members and casual riders. Members ride most frequently during weekdays, with a noticeable peak in the middle of the week—aligning closely with typical commuting routines. In contrast, casual riders show a clear preference for weekends, especially Saturdays and Sundays, reinforcing their tendency to use the service for recreational purposes. This behavioral distinction is crucial for targeted marketing strategies and informed operational planning, allowing for more efficient resource allocation based on user type and day of the week.

### 🔹 Rides Started by Hour of Day
```{r fig.height=5,fig.width=10, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
clean_trip_data_2024_25 %>%
  count(hour, member_casual) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = n, color = member_casual)) +
 geom_line(size = 1.5) +
 geom_vline(xintercept = c(8, 17), linetype = "dashed", color = "gray50") +
 annotate("text", x = 8, y = 1.05 * max(clean_trip_data_2024_25$hour), 
           label = "8 AM Commute", angle = 90, vjust = -0.5, color = "gray40", size = 3) +
  annotate("text", x = 17, y = 1.05 * max(clean_trip_data_2024_25$hour), 
           label = "5 PM Commute", angle = 90, vjust = -0.5, color = "gray40", size = 3) +
 scale_x_continuous(breaks = 0:23) +
 scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +
 scale_color_manual(values = c("casual" = "#e31a1c", "member" = "#1f78b4")) +
 labs(
    title = "Rides Started by Hour of Day",
    subtitle = "Members peak during commuting hours (8 AM, 5 PM) while casual riders rise gradually",
    x = "Hour of Day (0–23)",
    y = "Number of Rides",
    color = "User Type" ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
    plot.caption = element_text(size = 9, hjust = 1, color = "gray40"),
    axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    axis.text = element_text(color = "black"),
    legend.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    legend.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
    panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = "gray90"),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
```

The plot above shows distinct time-of-day usage patterns between members and casual riders. Member activity features sharp peaks around 8 AM and 5 PM, which align with standard commuting hours, indicating a functional and time-bound usage. In contrast, casual rider activity gradually increases throughout the day, reaching its peak around 4 to 5 PM. This suggests that casual users engage with the service more flexibly, likely for leisure or spontaneous trips rather than scheduled travel.

### 🔹 Ride Duration Distribution Plot
``` {r ride_duration_distribution, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(
  clean_trip_data_2024_25 %>% filter(ride_length <= 120), 
  aes(x = ride_length, fill = member_casual, color = member_casual)
) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.4, size = 1.2, linetype = "solid", adjust = 1.5) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("casual" = "#FF6F61", "member" = "#00BFC4")) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("casual" = "#FF6F61", "member" = "#00BFC4")) +
  labs(
    title = "Ride Duration Distribution (≤ 120 min)",
    x = "Ride Length (Minutes)",
    y = "Density",
    fill = "User Type",
    color = "User Type"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

The plot above reveals that most rides fall within a short duration of 5 to 10 minutes. However, casual users display a much broader distribution, with a significant number of longer rides. This suggests that casual riders may be using the service to explore, relax, or travel longer distances at a leisurely pace. In contrast, member ride durations are tightly clustered within the shorter range, reinforcing the idea that they prioritize efficiency—likely using the bikes for quick, purpose-driven trips such as commuting.

## 🚀 Act
The ACT phase of the analysis involves using insights gained from the previous data exploration and visualization steps to make informed decisions or take actionable steps. This phase will focus on applying the findings from our previous analysis of ride duration, usage patterns, and user behavior to optimize the bike-sharing service’s operations and marketing strategies.

### Key Insights from Previous Analysis

1. **Casual Riders vs. Members**: Casual riders tend to take longer trips, especially on weekends, while members have shorter, more consistent ride durations.
2. **Seasonality**: Both user types show strong seasonality, with usage peaking during the summer months (June to September). Casual riders are more sensitive to weather conditions, while members maintain steadier usage year-round.
3. **Time-of-Day Usage**: Member usage peaks during weekdays, especially at 8 AM and 5 PM, aligning with typical commuting hours. Casual rider activity peaks on weekends and rises steadily throughout the day.
4. **Ride Duration**: Most rides are short (5-10 minutes), but casual riders tend to have a broader range of ride durations, including many longer trips.

### Actionable Recommendations

Based on these insights, several recommendations can be made:

#### 1. **Targeted Marketing Campaigns for Casual Riders**
   - **Leisure Focus**: Marketing campaigns aimed at casual riders should emphasize leisure and weekend activities, such as scenic routes or weekend deals.
   - **Weather-Dependent Promotions**: Since casual riders are more weather-sensitive, seasonal promotions or discounts could be offered during the summer months to encourage more rides.

#### 2. **Seasonal Adjustments in Operations**
   - **Fleet Adjustments**: During peak summer months, increase the fleet of bikes available, especially in areas with high casual rider traffic. Conversely, consider reducing fleet size during the winter to optimize operational costs.
   - **Weather-Responsive Operations**: Implement real-time monitoring of weather forecasts to adjust bike availability for casual riders. For example, offer incentives during sunny days to boost usage.

#### 3. **Operational Efficiency for Short Rides**
   - **Quick Rentals**: Since most rides are short, streamline the rental process and increase the availability of bikes near high-traffic, short-trip areas (e.g., business districts or transit stations).
   - **Focus on Efficiency for Members**: Ensure that members have quick access to bikes with minimal hassle, supporting their need for efficient and timely travel.
